BUILDING:

    1.	Make sure you have imake.
	(See the BUILDNOTES file if you want to try building with X11R4).

    2.	Do "xmkmf" to create the initial Makefile.  

        For Unixware 7, use 

	"imake -DUseInstalled -I/usr/lib/X11/config"

    3.	Do "make World" (note the uppercase World) to build the distribution.

	If you'd like to enable the option of having the audio library
	automatically start up an NAS server on the local host when
	necessary, use the following command to build the
	distribution:

	make WORLDOPTS='-k CDEBUGFLAGS="$(CDEBUGFLAGS) -DSTARTSERVER"' World

    4.	If everything built successfully, you can install it using
	"make install"; to temporarily stage it under some directory, use
	"make install DESTDIR=/usr/tmp/nas" or some such.

    5.	To install the manual pages, use "make install.man" or 
	"make install.man DESTDIR=/usr/tmp/nas" as above.
