This directory tree contains sources for the Network Audio System, a
network-transparent, client/server audio system, including:

    o   sample server implementations

	- VOXware (FreeBSD, Linux, NetBSD, OpenBSD, SVR4.[02],
          Unixware 2.x/7.x)

	- HPUX 10.10.X, 11.x

	- Microsoft Windows under Cygwin

	- SunOS 4.1.[23], Solaris 2.x, (Sparc and Intel)

	- Sun Sparc 1 AM79C30A Digital Subscriber Controller and
	      Sparc 10 Dual Basic Rate ISDN Interface

	- SGI Indigo (IRIX 5.x)

    o	an application programming interface library
    o	a variety of sample applications


The client software can also be used with several models of NCD X
terminals as well as NCD's PCXware (an X server for PCs running
Microsoft Windows).

Key features of the Network Audio System include:

    o	Device-independent audio over the network
    o	Lots of audio file and data formats
    o	Can store sounds in server for rapid replay
    o	Extensive mixing, separating, and manipulation of audio data
    o	Simultaneous use of audio devices by multiple applications
    o	Use by a growing number of ISVs
    o	Small size
    o	Free!  No obnoxious licensing terms

Please note that the Network Audio System has no relationship to the NetAudio 
products from Townshend Computer Tools.

Look at the file doc/xcon94paper.ps for a paper on the Network Audio
System.

A X11 build environment (make, xmkmf, imake, X11/ headers, etc) is
required to compile NAS.

				 *  *  *  *  *

I.  Roadmap

Here is a quick guide to where things are in this distribution (relative to
the directory nas/):

	README			this file
	FAQ                     some common questions
	HISTORY			log of changes
	BUGS			known landmines
	BUILDNOTES		notes on building under various OSs, X releases
	TODO			things we'd like to get around to doing
	RELEASE			release identification
	doc/			not enough documentation; overview, slides, lib
	config/			a little bit of imake stuff
	lib/audio/		API used by sample programs
	clients/audio/		sample programs
	server/			server code
	    dia/		device-independent bits
	    dda/sun/		device-dependent audio driver for Sun
	    dda/sgi/		device-dependent audio driver for SGI Indigo
	    dda/voxware/	device-dependent audio driver for VOXware
	    dda/hpux/		device-dependent audio driver for Hpux

When built, the server will be in server/nasd, the library in
lib/audio/libaudio.a, lib/audio/libaudio.so.*, and the sample
applications in clients/audio/aufoo/aufoo.

In addition, the separate distribution sounds.tar.Z contains a directory of
example sounds:

	examples/sounds/	various sounds that can be played

If you don't have your own sound bites to nibble, grab these.

				 *  *  *  *  *

II.  Building the Release

To build the software:

    1.	Make sure you have imake.
	(See the BUILDNOTES file if you want to try building with X11R4).

    2.	Do "xmkmf" to create the initial Makefile.

        For Unixware 7, use:

        "imake -DUseInstalled -I/usr/lib/X11/config"

    3.	Do "make World" (note the uppercase World) to build the distribution.

	If you'd like to enable the option of having the audio library
	automatically start up an NAS server on the local host when
	necessary, use the following command to build the
	distribution:

	make WORLDOPTS='-k CDEBUGFLAGS="$(CDEBUGFLAGS) -DSTARTSERVER"' World

    4.	If everything built successfully, you can install it using
	"make install"; to temporarily stage it under some directory, use
	"make install DESTDIR=/usr/tmp/nas" or some such.

    5.	To install the manual pages, use "make install.man" or 
	"make install.man DESTDIR=/usr/tmp/nas" as above.

A complete installation should include the following files:

	/usr/include/audio/Afuncproto.h		Header files
	/usr/include/audio/Afuncs.h
	/usr/include/audio/Amd.h
	/usr/include/audio/Aos.h
	/usr/include/audio/Aosdefs.h
	/usr/include/audio/Aproto.h
	/usr/include/audio/audio.h
	/usr/include/audio/Alibint.h
	/usr/include/audio/Alibnet.h
	/usr/include/audio/Xtutil.h
	/usr/include/audio/audiolib.h
	/usr/include/audio/audioutil.h
	/usr/include/audio/snd.h
	/usr/include/audio/wave.h
	/usr/include/audio/voc.h
	/usr/include/audio/aiff.h
	/usr/include/audio/sound.h
	/usr/include/audio/soundlib.h
	/usr/include/audio/fileutil.h
	/usr/include/audio/8svx.h
	/usr/include/audio/Astreams.h

	/usr/bin/X11/auconvert			Sample programs
	/usr/bin/X11/auctl
	/usr/bin/X11/audemo
	/usr/bin/X11/audial
	/usr/bin/X11/auedit
	/usr/bin/X11/auinfo
	/usr/bin/X11/aupanel
	/usr/bin/X11/auplay
	/usr/bin/X11/aurecord

	/usr/bin/X11/auwave
	/usr/bin/X11/auphone
	/usr/bin/X11/auscope
	/usr/bin/X11/soundtoh
	/usr/bin/X11/issndfile
	/usr/bin/X11/playbucket
	/usr/bin/X11/checkmail

	/usr/man/mann/*.n			Client, server, and misc
						man pages

	/usr/man/man3/*.3			API man pages

	/usr/lib/libaudio.[a|so]		API library
	/usr/lib/X11/AuErrorDB			Error database

	/usr/bin/X11/nasd			NAS server for your
						hardware (voxware,
						sun, hpux and sgi)

				 *  *  *  *  *

III.  Using the Network Audio System

Now that you have things built, you can use the Network Audio System
as follows (assuming ksh):

	$  nasd -aa &		# -aa allows any host access
	$  export AUDIOSERVER="`hostname`:0"
	$  auinfo
	$  audemo examples/sounds
	$  ...

If you are using it over the network, the shorthand syntax for specifying an
audio server is hostname:0.  Access control is still a bit primitive....

				 *  *  *  *  *

IV.  Using the Network Audio System with Sun Deskset

The "autool" program can be used as a replacement for audiotool.  This
allows Sun Deskset applications (e.g. mailtool, etc.) to be used with
the Network Audio System.  See the autool man page
(clients/audio/autool/autool.man) for details on how to configure
Deskset.

				 *  *  *  *  *

V.  Games

Well, now that you have networked audio, it's time to actually use it
for something.  XBoing and xpilot are both distributed with Network
Audio System support.  Check ftp.x.org:/contrib/audio/nas/contrib for
other applications that support the Network Audio System.

				 *  *  *  *  *

VI.  Finding Sounds to Play With

Users with some versions of SunOS can find a number of audio files to
listen to in /usr/demo/SOUND/sounds/.  Once the Network Audio System
is running, they can be examined using:

	%  audemo /usr/demo/SOUND/sounds

A separate tar archive called sounds.tar.Z is available from ftp.x.org.

For the true audio packrat, there are a number of anonymous ftp sites that
contain archives of thousands of sound bites.  The "Sound Site Newsletter"
published periodically on comp.sys.ibm.pc.soundcard, comp.sys.ibm.pc.misc, and
rec.games.misc contains a detailed list of machines, bulletin boards, etc.

				 *  *  *  *  *

VII.  For More Information

There is mailing list for folks who are working with the Network
Audio System:

    nas@radscan.com		General discussion of the Network
				Audio System 

    majordomo@radscan.com	Where to send requests to get on or off the
				mailing list.  The body of the mail should
				contain a single line stating:

					subscribe nas <your_email_address>


    The archives for this list can be found at:

        http://radscan.com/nas/nas-ml/

    A web page dedicated to NAS can be found at 

	http://radscan.com/nas.html

	This site will contain up to date information on
	NAS, and probably the most recent version (including
	point release and development versions).

        http://radscan.com/nas/nas-links.hmtl 

	This page provides a small list of some utilities and software
        that incorporates or uses NAS. 
	

The Network Audio System has benefited greatly from the testing and
contributions of many people on the mailing list.  We'd like to thank
them for their help and encourage everyone to participate in the
on-going development process.

We hope you enjoy the Network Audio System.  There're still a few
pieces to be added, but already a significant number of hardware and
software vendors are finding that it solves their problems.  Besides,
you can't beat the price!  :-)
