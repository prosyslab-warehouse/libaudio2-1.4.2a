  This directory contains some useful contributions from various NAS
  users.


  - rc/

    a sample SYSV init system startup file for starting nasd.

  - esound/

    A patch supplied by Laurent Vivier that adds NAS support to the
    esound daemon on AIX systems.  The code appears well written and
    could probably be easily adapted to esound server on other
    platforms.  This patch is against version 0.2.29 of esound.
