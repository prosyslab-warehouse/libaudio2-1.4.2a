Currently, the following data formats are defined:
\fBAuFormatULAW8\fP, \fBAuFormatLinearUnsigned8\fP, \fBAuFormatLinearSigned8\fP, \fBAuFormatLinearSigned16MSB\fP, \fBAuFormatLinearUnsigned16MSB\fP, \fBAuFormatSignedLinear16LSB\fP, and \fBAuFormatLinearUnsigned16LSB\fP.
.IP \fBAuFormatULAW8\fP 1i
Designates a data format in which samples are stored as 8-bit ulaw values.
.IP \fBAuFormatLinearUnsigned8\fP 1i
Designates a data format in which samples are stored as unsigned 8-bit values.
.IP \fBAuFormatLinearSigned8\fP 1i
Designates a data format in which samples are stored as signed 8-bit values.
.IP \fBAuFormatLinearSigned16MSB\fP 1i
Designates a data format in which samples are stored as signed 16-bit values, with the most significant byte first.
.IP \fBAuFormatLinearUnsigned16MSB\fP 1i
Designates a data format in which samples are stored as unsigned 16-bit values, with the most significant byte first.
.IP \fBAuFormatSignedLinear16LSB\fP 1i
Designates a data format which samples are stored as signed 16-bit values, with the least significant byte first.
.IP \fBAuFormatLinearUnsigned16LSB\fP 1i
Designates a data format which samples are stored as unsigned 16-bit values, with the least significant byte first.
