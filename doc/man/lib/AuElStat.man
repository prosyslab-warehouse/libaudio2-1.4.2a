.IP \fIflow\fP 1i
Specifies the flow.
.IP \fIelement_num\fP 1i
Specifies the index of the element of interest.
Use \fBAuElementAll\fP to access the state of the flow.
.IP \fIstate\fP 1i
Specifies the state of the element (or flow) specified by \fIelement_num\fP.
This should be one of thses constants: \fBAuStateStop\fP, \fBAuStateStart\fP, or \fBAuStatePause\fP.
.SH \fBDescription\fP
The \fBAuElementState\fP structure is used to access the state of elements in a flow.
Only flows and component elements (ExportBucket, ExportClient, ExportDevice, ImportClient, ImportDevice, ImportBucket, and ImportWaveForm) have state.
