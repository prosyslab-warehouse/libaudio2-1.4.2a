.SH \fBMembers\fP
.IP \fItype\fP 1i
The event type.
GrabNotify events are type \fBAuEventTypeGrabNotify\fP.
.IP \fIserial\fP 1i
The serial ID of the event expanded from the 16 bit value sent by the server.
.IP \fIsend_event\fP 1i
\fBAuTrue\fP if the event came from a \fBSendEvent\fP protocol request.
.IP \fIserver\fP 1i
The connection to the audio server that the event was read from.
.IP \fItime\fP 1i
The server time in milliseconds when the event was generated.
.IP \fIid\fP 1i
The ID of the component grabbed.
.IP \fIkind\fP 1i
Either \fBAuGrabNotifyKindRequested\fP or \fBAuGrabNotifyKindReleased\fP.
.IP \fIpad1\fP 1i
.IP \fIpad2\fP 1i
.IP \fIclient\fP 1i
The client making the grab.
.SH \fBDescription\fP
GrabNotify events are sent to client applications to notify them that a component has been grabbed or released.
.SH \fBNotes\fP
\fBNot implemented\fP.
So this is all just speculation.
.SH \fBSee Also\fP
