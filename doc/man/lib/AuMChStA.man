.IP \fIaction\fP 1i
Returns the initialized action.
.IP \fItrigger_state\fP 1i
Specifies the state that triggers the action.
This must be one of these constants: \fBAuStateStop\fP, \fBAuStateStart\fP, \fBAuStatePause\fP, or \fBAuStateAny\fP.
.IP \fItrigger_prev_state\fP 1i
Specifies the previous state for the trigger.
This must be one of these constants: \fBAuStateStop\fP, \fBAuStateStart\fP, \fBAuStatePause\fP, or \fBAuStateAny\fP.
.IP \fItrigger_reason\fP 1i
Specifies the reason for the action.
This must be one of these constants: \fBAuReasonUser\fP, \fBAuReasonUnderrun\fP, \fBAuReasonOverrun\fP, \fBAuReasonEOF\fP, \fBAuReasonWatermark\fP, \fBAuReasonHardware\fP, or \fBAuReasonAny\fP.
.IP \fIflow\fP
Specifies the ID of the flow to affect.
.IP \fIelement_num\fP 1i
Specifies the index of the element to affect.
.IP \fInew_state\fP 1i
Specifies the new state for the flow.
This must be one of thses constants: \fBAuStateStop\fP, \fBAuStateStart\fP, or \fBAuStatePause\fP.
