.SH \fBArguments\fP
.IP \fIserver\fP 1i
Specifies the connection to the audio server.
.IP \fIhandler\fP 1i
Specifies the non-fatal error handler.
Use NULL to reinstall the default handler.
.SH \fBDescription\fP
\fBAuSetErrorHandler\fP sets the non-fatal error handler and returns the previous handler.
This error handler will be invoked whenever a non-fatal error (error event) is received.
As this condition is not assumed to be fatal, it is acceptable for the error handler to return.
However, the error handler should not call any functions (directly or indirectly) on the server that will generate protocol requests or that will look for input events.
