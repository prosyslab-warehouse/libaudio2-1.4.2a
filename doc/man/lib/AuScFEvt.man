.SH \fBArguments\fP
.IP \fIserver\fP 1i
Specifies the connection to the audio server.
.IP \fImode\fP 1i
Specifies how far to look for a match.
This should be one of these constants: \fBAuEventsQueuedAlready\fP, \fBAuEventsQueuedAfterReading\fP, or \fBAuEventsQueuedAfterFlush\fP.
.IP \fIdequeue\fP 1i
Specifies if a matching event is found, should it be removed from the queue.
.IP \fItype\fP 1i
Specifies the type of event to match.  The type should be one of these constants: \fBAuEventTypeElementNotify\fP, \fBAuEventTypeGrabNotify\fP, or \fBAuEventTypeMonitorNotify\fP.
.IP \fIevent\fP 1i
Returns the matching event if found. 
.SH \fBDescription\fP
\fBAuScanForTypedEvent\fP scans the event queue looking for the first event that matches \fItype\fP.
If \fImode\fP is \fBAuEventsQueuedAlready\fP, \fBAuScanForTypedEvent\fP only checks for events already in the queue.
If \fImode\fP is \fBAuEventsQueuedAfterReading\fP, and a matching event isn't found already in the queue, \fBAuScanForTypedEvent\fP attempts to read more events out of the application's connection.
If \fImode\fP is \fBAuEventsQueuedAfterFlush\fP and a matching event isn't already in the queue or isn't waiting to be read, \fBAuScanForTypedEvent\fP flushes the output queue and attempts to read more events out of the application's connection.
If \fIdequeue\fP is \fBAuTrue\fP, and a matching event is found, it is removed from the queue.
