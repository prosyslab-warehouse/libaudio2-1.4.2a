longer used.  This section was in the authors portion of the manpage,
and should be preserved for history's sake :) I have removed the email
addresses, and mention of the original X11 Display server authors.
See the X11 source and documanetation code that information.]

The auvoxware server contains much code from the sun sample server, written
originally by Greg Renda and Dave Lemke of NCD, who in turn borrowed much
code from the sample X server. 

The original VOXware server for Linux was written by Amancio Hasty and
was merged with the SVR4 VOXware server, written by Stephen Hocking.
Christian Schlichtherle then added some more Linux fixes, code to
allow full duplex operation on those cards that supported it (GUS,
PAS16, AudioTriX) and did some work on the 16 bit code. Stephen
Hocking made sure it ran under FreeBSD. Shawn M. fixed it up to run
under SCO Unix and added code to dynamically adjust the buffer sizes.
Stephen Hocking then added code for the server to use a configuration
file.
